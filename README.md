2. Analyzed data to understand why employees are leaving and how the organization can improve retention.
3. Implemented interactive pivot tables for a dynamic exploration of HR data, allowing users to filter and analyze information based on specific criteria.
4. Created dynamic dashboards and predictive models in MS Excel for real-time attrition trend monitoring.
5. Enhanced data visualization through charts and graphs to convey complex attrition insights in a clear and comprehensible manner.
